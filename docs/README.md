# Introduction

The events sdk is a small sdk that handles real time communication with our servers.

The SDK has automatic server failover and fallback integrated as well as different utilities such as debug mode to easily visualize what's happening in the 
console.
 
The SDK uses websockets to manage real time bi-directional communication with our servers and it's meant to simplify developer work. Find our more in the links below.
